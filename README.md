Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that significantly impacts the quality of life. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective management and treatment. This project, titled "Automated Knee Osteoarthritis Prediction and Classification from X-ray Images Using Deep Learning," presents a novel approach for diagnosing and grading knee OA using deep learning models.
The system is developed using Python for backend computation, Flask as the web framework, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Two state-of-the-art deep learning models, VGG16 and MobileNetV2, have been employed to classify X-ray images of knee joints into five categories based on the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system: Normal, Doubtful, Mild, Moderate, and Severe![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4857c98-50c9-4c6a-aab4-727e19052bbe)
